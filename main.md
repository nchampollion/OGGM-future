# Building together the future of OGGM

The aim of this work is to think, discuss, exchange together about global modelling of mountain glaciers applied to the OGGM model in a calloborative way and by taking time! The results should serve us to provide ideas to our projects, code developments, students work and maybe more largely to other researchers. It also aims to advertise about the synergies between glacier models, and also the limitations.

## **Introduction**

**OGGM is an open source modelling framework for glaciers**

The model accounts for glacier geometry (including contributory branches) and includes an explicit ice dynamics module and a calving parametrization. It can simulate past and future mass-balance, volume and geometry of (almost) any glacier in the world in a fully automated and extensible workflow. We rely exclusively on publicly available data for calibration and validation. OGGM is modular and supports novel modelling workflows: it loves to be remixed and reused! (see **https://oggm.org/** for more information about the model and code, and **https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/12/909/2019/** for more information about the physic)

##Â **1. What is OGGM model able to do today (which is not ongoing work) ?**
- Doing long-term simulation, e.g. superior to 200-300 years
- Performing climate variability simulations, e.g. looking to the seasonal mass balances or to ENSO influence on global glacier mass variations
- Coupling global hydrological model with runoff calculated by OGGM
- 

## **2. Which studies can be performed by code development of the OGGM model (which code development) ?**
- Global debris-covered simulations (global test and calibration of the developing debris-covered parametrisation)
- Influence of ocean water warming to frontal ablation for tidewater glaciers (adding a temperature dependency to the frontal ablation)
- Modeling rock glaciers (new surface mass-balance module and new rheology)
- 

## **3. Which studies could be possible to conduct with technological break development ? Which break development ?**
- Large scale Mars ice sheet simulation
- Surface velocity data assimilation
- Spatial distribution of surface mass balance and ice dynamic
- Finer temporal and spatial resolution
- Coupling OGGM SMB and Elmer/Ice dynamic

## **4. Where to go with a glacier model ?**
- Which model complexity do we need ? Is more complex model the ennemy of more precise simulation ?
- Is it suitable a large and flexible framework including lot of different SMB/ice dynamic modules or different models ?
- 

## **5. Which essential scientific questions can not be replied with OGGM ?**
- Long-term past reconstruction ?
- 

## **Conclusion**

Building a word cloud about what OGGM represents ?
